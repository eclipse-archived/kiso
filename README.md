## Introduction ##
Eclipse Kiso was designed from scratch as a software development kit for IoT devices and has already been used and verified on a handful of existing products in the market. Eclipse Kiso's reusability, robustness and portability is a key factor which enables fast development and quick time to market for almost all kinds of IoT "Things" product development.

An overview of what the repository contains and what you can do with it can be found in the doxygen documentation.
