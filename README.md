## Introduction ##
The Bosch Connected Devices Development Kit (CDDK) has been originally used to develop several industrial and end-user products. Its historical SW roots go back to 2013 where it has been designed from scratch as a software development kit (SDK) for internet of things (IoT) devices. CDDK's core components faciliate a real time operating system approach to target small footprints and low power consumption. It is not limited to a single OS and offers a broad HW support (boards and sensors).

Kiso (Japanese for "basis") is an Eclipse Foundation project that is using the original code base of CDDK. Kiso is transferring the Bosch proprietary licence code piece-by-piece to EPLv2 open source. Kiso's quality goals - understandability, usability, product quality, extensibility and performance - are the key factors that enable a fast prototype and product development. By this, it reduces the time to market together with minimizing technical debts for almost all kinds of IoT "Things".

## Scope ##
To learn what Kiso is and how it can help you, please have a look at our [scope](http://kiso.rempler.de:1313/project-overview/scope.html) page.

## Quick start ##
Please take a look at the [quick start](http://kiso.rempler.de:1313/user-guide/quick_start.html) section in the user manual documentation.

## Support ##
Community support is provided via Mattermost, see [Kiso channel](https://mattermost.eclipse.org/eclipse/channels/kiso). An Eclipse Foundation Mattermost account is needed.

## Resources ##
Please note that (for now) some of the following links require additional accounts and/or are limited to Bosch infrastructure access. This is a temporary impediment until Kiso's infrastructure has been moved over to Eclipse Foundation.
