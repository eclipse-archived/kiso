## Introduction ##
Eclipse Kiso was designed from scratch as a software development kit (SDK) for IoT devices. It has been used for developing a handful of existing products in the market. Kiso's reusability, robustness and portability is a key factor that enables fast development and reduces time to market for almost all kinds of IoT "Things" product development.

## Quick start ##
Please take a look at [quick start](http://kiso.rempler.de:1313/3.-user-guide/quick_start/)

## Support ##
Community support is provided via Mattermost, see Kiso channel https://mattermost.eclipse.org/eclipse/channels/kiso
