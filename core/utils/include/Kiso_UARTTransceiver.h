 *
 * @brief
 *      Advanced API functions for sending and receiving via UART and LEUART
 *
 * @details
 *      The UARTTransceiver encapsulates the handling of buffers
 *      and the control flow.
 *
 *      The typical use of the UARTTransceiver starts with initializing it.
 *
 *      The transceiver supports two operation modes: synchronous mode and
 *      asynchronous mode.The transceiver is started in the synchronous mode
 *      by calling the function UARTTransceiver_Start().
 *      In order to operate the transceiver in the asynchronous mode, the function
 *      UARTTransceiver_StartInAsyncMode() should be used instead.
 *      After the start, the transceiver starts to receive
 *      bytes, in the ISR context, and store them internally into a ring buffer.
 *      While receiving the transceiver applies the end-of-frame check function to
 *      every received byte. If it returns true, then the transceiver will perform
 *      one of the following action depending on its operation mode:
 *           1. In the asynchronous mode, the registered callback is invoked to notify
 *           the upper-layer. The upper-layer will fetch the data from the transceiver's
 *           buffer using the function UARTTransceiver_ReadData().
 *           2. In the synchronous mode, the upper-layer is expected to call
 *           UARTTransceiver_ReadData(). The call is blocking. When the end-of-frame check
 *           function returns true, the semaphore is released such that the call
 *           of UARTTransceiver_ReadData() returns, where
 *           the frame is copied into the buffer which was passed as a parameter.
 *
 *      The function UARTTransceiver_WriteData() sends data via the under-laying UART
 *      or LEUART. In the asynchronous mode, the write operation triggers the
 *      sending and returns. A callback follows to inform the upper-layer about
 *      the success or failure of the operation.
 *      In the synchronous mode, the write operation blocks until all bytes are sent. No
 *      callback will follow.
 *
 *      UARTTransceiver provides also the functions UARTTransceiver_Suspend(),
 *      UARTTransceiver_Resume(), UARTTransceiver_Stop() to control the activity
 *      of the transceiver, in particular the receiving activity in the background.
 *
 * @note
 *      UARTTransceiver is a passive component without an own task. It is driven
 *      by the caller task and the interrupts coming form UART or LEUART.
 *
 * @note
 *      UARTTransceiver maintains its context in a struct which makes it ready
 *      for multiple-instance use. This means, multiple UARTTransceiver
 *      instances may co-exist in the same application. However, they must operate on
 *      different UART or LEUART ports.
