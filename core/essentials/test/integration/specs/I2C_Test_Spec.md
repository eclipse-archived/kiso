### Description

* Purpose
  + Test the I2C transfer functionality

* Test participants:
  - Device under Test (DUT): Stm32 - Bike Sensor Board (BSE)
  - Test Coordinator: PC

### Test Setup
The test setup consists of the test coordinator and 1 test participant

* Test Coordinator (on PC)
* The DUT is connected to the PC via UART which is the Test Coordination Channel. The embedded C testling code is flashed onto the DUT.
* The DUT is connected to a 12 V power source.
* For this selfcontained test, no external wires are necessary and only BSE-internal Sensors are polled via I2C.

On the BSE testling, the initialization sequence setups the I2C Clock and the I2C GPIOs:

* I2C SCL line: GPIO_PIN_14, Bank GPIOG, mode GPIO_PULLUP, GPIO_SPEED_LOW
* I2C SDA line: GPIO_PIN_13, Bank GPIOG, mode GPIO_PULLUP, GPIO_SPEED_LOW
* Alternative function: GPIO_AF4_I2C1
* I2C Clock: PCLK1
* enable GPIO bank G clock
* power up GPIO bank G (PWR_CR2_IOSV register)
* IRQs I2Cx_ER_IRQn and I2Cx_EV_IRQn are enabled
