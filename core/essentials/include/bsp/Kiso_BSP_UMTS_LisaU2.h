 * @brief       BSP API for LISAU2 UMTS/HSPA controller from Ublox.
 * <A HREF="https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/LISA-U2_DataSheet_%28UBX-13001734%29.pdf"><B>Datasheet</B></A>
 * @details
 * After reset, the microcontroller GPIOs are mostly tristated. Once the device is requested a call to
 * BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_Connect() function is required to map its GPIOs to their desired function (input, output, SPI, etc).
 *
 * A call to BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_Enable() will execute the required sequence to enable the device and its dedicated
 * MCU resources (e.g. SPI). The Device is then **controllable** through the microcontroller.
 *
 * BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_Disable() will revert back what the BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_Enable() has done and set the device and its related
 * MCU resources into disabled state.
 *
 * BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_Disconnect() will put the GPIO pins to the lowest power consumption and risk free configuration.
 * e.g. high impedance. 
 *
 * BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_GetHandle() will return a pointer to the MCU resource structure created and initialized by the BSP
 * implementation. This structure is MCU specific and its proper initialization is mandatory for the proper function of
 * the device. The Handle is the only contract between MCU layer and BSP layer.
 *
 * From the datasheet of the device there was necessity to complement those
 * functions with other minimum service functions:
 * - BSP_UMTS_LisaU2_Reset() attempts to reset the peripheral if the commands
 *   fail to execute.
 *
 * The following diagram describes the states and transitions for the UMTS controller:
