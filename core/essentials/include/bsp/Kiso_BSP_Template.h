 * @brief       BSP API for Template device from Template Manufacturer.
 * <A HREF="https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/products_overview"><B>Datasheet</B></A>
 * @details
 * After reset, the micro	controller GPIOs are mostly tristated. Once the device is requested a call to
 * BSP_Template_Connect() function is required to map its GPIOs to their desired function (input, output, SPI, etc).
 *
 * A call to BSP_Template_Enable() will execute the required sequence to enable the device and its dedicated
 * MCU resources (e.g. SPI). The device is then **controllable** through the microcontroller.
 *
 * BSP_Template_Disable() will revert back what the BSP_Tempplate_Enable() has done and set the device and its related
 * MCU resources into disabled state.
 *
 * BSP_Template_Disconnect() will put the GPIO pins to the lowest power consumption and risk free configuration.
 * e.g. high impedance. 
 *
 * BSP_Template_GetHandle() will return a pointer to the MCU resource structure created and initialized by the BSP
 * implementation. This structure is MCU specific and its proper initialization is mandatory for the proper function of
 * the accelerometer. The Handle is the only contract between MCU layer and BSP layer.
 *
 * The following diagram describes the states and transitions for the device
 * @dot
