 * @brief       BSP API for BMM150 Magnetometer sensor from Bosch Sensortec.

 * @details
 * After reset, the microcontroller GPIOs are mostly tristated. Once the magnetometer is requested a call to
 * BSP_BMM150_Connect() function is required to map its GPIOs to their desired function (input, output, SPI, etc).
 *
 * A call to BSP_BMM150_Enable() will execute the required sequence to enable the magnetometer and its dedicated
 * MCU resources (e.g. SPI). The magnetometer is then **controllable** through the microcontroller.
 *
 * BSP_BMM150_Disable() will revert back what the BSP_BMM150_Enable() has done and set the
 * magnetometer and its related MCU resources into disabled state.
 *
 * BSP_BMM150_Disconnect() will put the GPIO pins to the lowest power consumption and risk free configuration
 * e.g. high impedance.
 *
 * BSP_BMM150_GetHandle() will return a pointer to the MCU resource structure created and initialized by the BSP
 * implementation. This structure is MCU specific and its proper initialization is mandatory for the proper function of
 * the magnetometer. The Handle is the only contract between MCU layer and BSP layer.
 *
 * The following diagram describes the states and transitions for the BMM150 magnetometer :
