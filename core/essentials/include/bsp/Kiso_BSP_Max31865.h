 * @brief       BSP API for MAX31865 RTD-to-Digital Converter from Maxim Integrated.
 * <A HREF="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31865.pdf"><B>Datasheet</B></A>
 * @details
 * After reset, the microcontroller GPIOs are mostly tristated. Once the device is requested a call to
 * BSP_Max31865_Connect() function is required to map its GPIOs to their desired function (input, output, SPI, etc).
 *
 * A call to BSP_Max31865_Enable() will execute the required sequence to enable the device and its dedicated
 * MCU resources (e.g. SPI). The Device is then **controllable** through the microcontroller.
 *
 * BSP_Max31865_Disable() will revert back what the BSP_Max31865_Enable() has done and set the device and its related
 * MCU resources into disabled state.
 *
 * BSP_Max31865_Disconnect() will put the GPIO pins to the lowest power consumption and risk free configuration.
 * e.g. high impedance.
 *
 * BSP_Max31865_GetHandle() will return a pointer to the MCU resource structure created and initialized by the BSP
 * implementation. This structure is MCU specific and its proper initialization is mandatory for the proper function of
 * the device. The Handle is the only contract between MCU layer and BSP layer.
 *
 * The following diagram describes the states and transitions for the converter device
 * @dot
