 * @brief       BSP API for PWM controlled buzzers.
 *
 * @details
 * After reset, the microcontroller GPIOs are mostly tristated. Once the device is requested a call to
 * BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Connect() function is required to map its GPIOs to their desired function (input, output, SPI, etc).
 *
 * A call to BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Enable() will execute the required sequence to enable the device and its dedicated
 * MCU resources (e.g. SPI). The Device is then **controllable** through the microcontroller.
 *
 * BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Disable() will revert back what the BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Enable() has done and set the device and its related
 * MCU resources into disabled state.
 *
 * BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Disconnect() will put the GPIO pins to the lowest power consumption and risk free configuration.
 * e.g. high impedance. 
 *
 * BSP_PWM_Buzzer_GetHandle() will return a pointer to the MCU resource structure created and initialized by the BSP
 * implementation. This structure is MCU specific and its proper initialization is mandatory for the proper function of
 * the device. The Handle is the only contract between MCU layer and BSP layer.
 *
 * The following diagram describes the states and transitions for the PWM buzzer:
 * @dot
 * digraph state_diagram {
 *      INIT[color="blue", shape=record]
 *      INIT -> CONNECTED[style="dashed", label="BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Connect()"]

 *      DISCONNECTED -> CONNECTED [label="BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Connect()"]
 *      CONNECTED -> ENABLED [label="BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Enable()"]
 *      ENABLED -> DISABLED [label="BSP_PWM_Buzzer_Disable()"]
