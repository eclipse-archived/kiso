 *
 * @details     The C99 standard does not support static assertions, nor the sizeof() keyword in preprocessor macros.
 *              To be able to perform compilation time variable size related checks, this macro is provided as a
 *              workaround.
 *@note         The the macro has some limitations.
 *
 *              To check if the int integer type is 4 bytes long, the following
 *              static assertion can be used.
 * @code
 *  static_assert(sizeof(int) == 4, "The int type shall be 32 bits long.");
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning     This macro can't be used twice on the same __LINE__ number. The user must ensure that even in header
 *              files the __LINE__ number is always unique. Protect header files against multiple time inclusions and
 *              if possible put static assertions into C files instead of headers.
 *
 *
 * @param[in]   expression : A logical statement which can be true or false.
 *
 * @param[in]   message : A string about the test case - note that it is not compiled into the code.
