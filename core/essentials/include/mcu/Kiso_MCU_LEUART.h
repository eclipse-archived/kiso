 * @brief Unified LEUART (Low Energy Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Interface
 *
 * @details A typical use of this API would start with initializing the LEUART instance.
 * This will initializes the LEUART with default settings.
 *
 * @code
 * retcode = MCU_LEUART_Initialize(leuart, callback);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, the LEUART is configured and active such that the communication can start.
 * The application should use the function MCU_LEUART_Receive() to receive a certain
 * number bytes. The call triggers the
 * receiving process and returns. The callback is invoked with an RxComplete
 * event when the expected number of bytes has been received.
 *
 * For sending, the application uses the function MCU_LEUART_Send(), which is 
 * non-blocking. A callback will happen to notify the application about the 
 * success or failure of the sending operation.
 *
 * The callback may be also called for other events such as errors.
 *
 * @note The callback function is usually invoked in the ISR context. The
 * implementation of the callback function must take this into account.

 * @note It is possible to disable the entire LEUART feature in the HAL-BSP
 * configuration file. I.e. the LEUART code will only be compiled and linked if
 * the feature <b>KISO_FEATURE_LEUART</b> is set to 1 in the configuration file.
 *
 * @note The driver may work in an interrupt- or DMA-based mode. This depends
 * on the implementation of the driver as well as on the way how the
 * UART hardware is initialized and configured in the BSP.
