 * @brief       Unified I2C Master Interface
 *
 * @details
 * The I2C hardware gets initialized by the Board support package. For an I2C device, the BSP API
 * exposes a getHandle() method which provides a handle for the I2C communication interface in use. That handle is used
 * by this driver to send and receive data.
 *
 * A typical use of this API would start with initializing the I2C instance by calling
 * MCU_I2C_Initialize(myI2CHandle, myI2CCallBack) where myI2CHandle is a reference to the I2C instance used by myDevice
 * and myI2CCallback is a callback function in the application layer which, in case the call mode is not blocking, will
 * be called to process I2C events.
 * After this, and if myDevice is in ENABLED state, the application/middleware should be able to use the other API
 * methods MCU_I2C_Send(), MCU_I2C_Receive(), etc...
 * a possible use case would be as follows:
 * @code
 * Retcode_T retcode;
 * retcode = BSP_MyDevice_Enable();
 * if(RETCODE_OK == retcode)
 * {
 *      myI2CHandle = BSP_MyDevice_GetHandle();
 *      retcode = MCU_I2C_Initialize(myI2CHandle, myI2CCallBack);
 * }
 * if(RETCODE_OK == retcode)
 * {
 *      retcode= MCU_I2C_ReadRegister();
 * }
 * if(RETCODE_OK == retcode)
 * {
 *      //do something
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note        It is possible to disable the entire I2C feature in the HAL-BSP configuration file. I.e. the I2C code
 * will only be compiled and linked if the feature <b>KISO_FEATURE_I2C</b> is set to 1 in the configuration file.
 *
 * @note        This interface only supports the I2C master mode.
 *
 * @note        This I2C interface only supports 7 bit addresses for slave addressing.
