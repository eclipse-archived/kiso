 * @brief Unified UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) Interface
 *
 * @details
 * A typical use of this API would start with initializing the UART instance. This will initializes the UART
 * with default settings.
 *
 * @code
 * retcode = MCU_UART_Initialize(uart, callback);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Now, the UART is configured and active such that the communication can start. The application should use the
 * function MCU_UART_Receive() to receive a certain number bytes. If receiving is non-blocking, the call triggers the
 * receiving process and returns. The callback is invoked with an RxComplete event when the expected number of bytes has
 * been received.
 *
 * For sending, the application uses the function MCU_UART_Send(). In a non-blocking mode a callback will happen to
 * notify the application about the success or failure of the sending operation.
 *
 * The callback may be also called for other events such as errors.
 *
 * @warning The callback function is usually invoked in the ISR context. The implementation of the callback function
 * must take this into account.

 * @note It is possible to disable the entire UART feature in the HAL BSP configuration file. I.e. the UART code will
 * only be compiled and linked if the feature <b>KISO_FEATURE_UART</b> is set to 1 in the configuration file.
 *
 * @note The driver may work in an interrupt- or DMA-based mode. This depends on the implementation of the driver as
 * well as on the way how the UART hardware is initialized and configured in the BSP.

 *                  number of bytes has been received.The received bytes are stored in the provided buffer. Unlike I2C
 *                  and SPI, UART is designed to receive streams. Hence, one call of MCU_UART_Receive(uart, buffer, n)
 *                  in non-blocking mode  will result in continuously receiving n bytes into the given buffer and

 *                  the next n bytes. In order to stop receiving, the upper-layer needs to call MCU_UART_Receive() with
 *                  the size of 0.
