# Example Project: <Title>

## Disclaimer
1. *The sample contents under various sections in this blueprint might seem to be utter non-sense and should be ignored. The aim was to make it crystal clear what these sections could contain as contents.*

2. *Add/remove sections which you believe are missing/redundant as per the concerned example.*

3. *Remove this disclaimer. :-)*

## Goal:
A one-to-two liner description of the absolute goal of this example.

e.g.(for c-leds) This examples demonstrates the usage of BSP API/functions to operate on-board LEDs on the 'x' board.

## Brief:
A paragraph that sheds more light on the goal already stated.
e.g.() In this example, we use the Kiso abstractions at the BSP layer(<link to location in user manual where BSP layer is explained>) to seamlessly switch on/off the leds. This demonstrates how a developer can access board-resources in a hardware-agnostic fashion.

### Components Required:
List the components that have been used in this example preferably with pics for HW components.

#### Software Components
*e.g. Third party libraries?*

#### Hardware Components

*Maybe links to vendors of components*

## (*Optional*) Initial Setup
Any hardware or software(environment) setup that needs to be done prior to execution/usage of the current example.


## (*Optional*) Execution Flow
For certain examples, perceived to be complex, a figurative projection of the execution flow will serve wonders in adapting the example by future developers.
*This section is optional as for very basic examples this might be a bit too much effort.*

## (*Optional*)Code Walkthrough
This section is inspired by this [project](https://github.com/eclipse/iceoryx/tree/master/iceoryx_examples/icedelivery). It describes some peculiarities in the code structure of the application like includes, datatypes(structs and what not), some key processing steps, some important condition checks etc.

*Experienced developers of Kiso are requested to evaluate what they want to emphasize here from the implementation.* 

## Expected Output

Specify what the user should obtain as an output of the execution the example. e.g. terminal output screenshots, pictures(flashing LEDs) etc.

## Troubleshooting

What can go wrong(most often) and how to solve the issue. Optionally a contact if not solvable by the user.
