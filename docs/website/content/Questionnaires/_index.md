##  Usability Questionnaire

**Usability** is one of the core assets of **Kiso**'s design. As soon as there is a BSP/MCU layer for the targeted hardware the matter of creating custom tailored applications should be handy based on the provided examples, the migration from one hardware to another (given BSP/MCU) should be also doable by only changing configuration parameters.

Usability is the second quality goal with it's two attributes:

- **(Configurability)**  each module can be configred for specific application purposes.

- **(Portability)**  Kiso supports applications to be protable to other hardware.

Please Tell us about your experience in building a customised application or migrating to another hardware: <a style="font: 15px Helvetica bold, sans-serif; color: #54CCA3; text-decoration: none;" href=http://kiso.rempler.de:8181/index.php/296258?lang=en> Usability Questionnaire  </a>

## Understandability Questionnaire

**Understandability** is **Kiso**'s top quality goal. **Kiso** aims to lower the entry barrier for embedded IoT developers, therefore there has been a concern about  how to ease the usage, starting from the toolchain environment preparation untill the running phase of the built application. The provided documentation should make all those steps clear and accurate.


Please tell us about your experience regarding the consistency of the user guides: <a style="font: 15px Helvetica bold, sans-serif; color: #54CCA3; text-decoration: none;" href=http://kiso.rempler.de:8181/index.php/427172?lang=en> Understandability Questionnaire </a>
